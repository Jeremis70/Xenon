# Design Rationale

This page summarizes motivations and design direction from current notes.

## Core intent

- Keep the language simple to use while remaining powerful.
- Support low-level systems programming and higher-level composition.
- Allow core building blocks to compose in user-extensible ways.

## Object-like core constructs (draft)

Draft notes emphasize that functions should behave like objects, and similar extensibility should apply to loops and conditionals.

## Non-goals (currently explicit)

No formal non-goal list is documented yet.

No doc yet. TODO: describe explicit non-goals and trade-offs (for example safety/performance ergonomics boundaries).
