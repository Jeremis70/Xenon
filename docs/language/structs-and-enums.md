# Structs and Enums

No doc yet. TODO: describe Xenon struct declarations, enum declarations, layout guarantees, visibility, methods, and pattern matching behavior.

## Current known mention

- A `struct Closure { ... }` example appears in trait/callable notes, but no formal struct syntax is specified.

## Open questions

- Are enums sum types, tagged unions, or both?
- Is memory layout explicit or implementation-defined?
